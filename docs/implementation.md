### 1. **Creating Your Own Implementation vs. Using Official Examples**

- **Using Official Examples:**
  - Official examples provided by the frameworks are usually well-tested and adhere to best practices. They are designed to showcase the optimal use of the framework features.
  - If the official examples closely match your use case, it's beneficial to use them as a base and adapt them to your needs. This can save time and ensure you're following best practices.

- **Creating Your Own Implementation:**
  - Custom implementations allow you to tailor the solution to your specific requirements and potentially cover edge cases not addressed by official examples.
  - If your use case is unique or significantly different from the examples provided, creating a custom solution might be necessary.

**Recommendation:** Start by examining the official examples on the framework's website. If they meet your needs, use them as a foundation. If your requirements are more complex or different, build upon the examples or create your own solution using the principles demonstrated.
