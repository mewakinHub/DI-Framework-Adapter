To make sure all packages are installed in your Conda environment in a single step, including both Conda and pip-managed packages, you can create a `requirements.txt` file and use a combination of Conda and pip to handle all dependencies.

### Step-by-Step Solution

#### Step 1: Create a `requirements.txt` File

First, create a `requirements.txt` file that includes both Conda and pip packages. Here's how to structure it:

1. **Conda-only packages**: These are packages that Conda can install directly.
2. **Pip-only packages**: These are packages that Conda cannot install, but pip can.

For example, your `requirements.txt` might look like this:

```text
# conda packages
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
pytest
pyyaml

# pip packages
pip:
  - injector
  - dependency-injector
  - pinject
  - wired
```

#### Step 2: Create an Environment YAML File

Alternatively, if you want Conda to handle both Conda and pip installations, you should create an environment YAML file (`environment.yml`). This file will allow you to specify dependencies for both Conda and pip in one place.

Here's an example `environment.yml`:

```yaml
name: DI-Adapter
dependencies:
  # Conda packages
  - python=3.11
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - pytest
  - pyyaml

  # Pip packages
  - pip
  - pip:
    - injector
    - dependency-injector
    - pinject
    - wired
```

#### Step 3: Create the Environment from the YAML File

Run the following command to create the environment with both Conda and pip packages:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

This command will:

1. Create a new environment named `DI-Adapter`.
2. Install all Conda packages listed under `dependencies`.
3. Install the pip packages using the pip tool within the Conda environment.

#### Step 4: Activate and Use the Environment

Activate the environment with:

```bash
conda activate DI-Adapter
```

After activation, all packages (both Conda-managed and pip-managed) will be available, and you can verify this by running:

```bash
conda list  # This will show all packages, including pip-installed ones
```

#### Step 5: Updating the Environment

If you need to add more packages later, you can update your environment with:

```bash
conda env update --file environment.yml --prune
```

The `--prune` flag removes dependencies that are no longer required from the environment.

### Summary

- **Use an `environment.yml` file** to specify both Conda and pip packages.
- **Create the environment** using `conda env create -f environment.yml`.
- **Activate the environment** and confirm all packages are installed using `conda list`.
  
This approach will ensure that both Conda and pip packages are correctly installed and visible in your Conda environment.

### Explanation of the Problem

The key issues causing your problems are related to:

1. **Python Environment Issues**:
   - The error `spawn c:\Users\mew\anaconda3\envs\DI-Adapter\python.exe ENOENT` indicates that Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is trying to use a Python executable that does not exist or cannot be found. This can happen if the Python environment (`DI-Adapter`) is not properly created or activated.

2. **Package Management Confusion**:
   - Even though you've installed packages with `pip`, `conda list` does not show them because `pip` installations are not managed by `conda`. This can cause discrepancies when working within `conda` environments.

### Steps to Resolve the Issues

To resolve these issues, follow the steps below:

#### Step 1: Verify Your Environment Setup

1. **Check Your Conda Environment**:
   Make sure your `DI-Adapter` environment is correctly set up. Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   conda env list
   ```

   You should see the `DI-Adapter` environment listed. If not, you'll need to recreate it.

2. **Recreate the Environment**:
   If the `DI-Adapter` environment is not properly created or has missing executables, recreate it with the following:

   ```bash
   conda remove -n DI-Adapter --all  # Remove the old environment
   conda create -n DI-Adapter python=3.11  # Recreate it with Python 3.11
   conda activate DI-Adapter  # Activate the new environment
   ```

#### Step 2: Install Packages Properly

Once the environment is activated, install the necessary packages:

1. **Install Packages with Conda**:

   ```bash
   conda install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib pytest pyyaml
   ```

2. **Install Remaining Packages with Pip**:

   ```bash
   pip install injector dependency-injector pinject wired
   ```

#### Step 3: Set the Correct Python Interpreter in VS Code

1. **Open Command Palette**:
   Use `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + P` (Mac) to open the Command Palette.

2. **Select Python Interpreter**:
   - Type `Python: Select Interpreter`.
   - Choose the interpreter for the newly created `DI-Adapter` environment.

3. **Reload VS Code**:
   Reload the window to apply the new interpreter settings.

#### Step 4: Fix the Pylint Configuration

1. **Install Pylint in Your Environment**:
   Make sure `pylint` is installed in your environment:

   ```bash
   pip install pylint
   ```

2. **Configure Pylint in VS Code**:
   - Open your settings (`Ctrl + ,`).
   - Search for `Pylint Path` and set it to the path of `pylint` in your `DI-Adapter` environment, for example: `C:\Users\mew\anaconda3\envs\DI-Adapter\Scripts\pylint.exe`.

#### Step 5: Test Your Setup

1. **Run Your Python Script**:
   After setting the interpreter, try running your Python script again from the terminal.

2. **Check for Errors**:
   Make sure that there are no import errors (`Unable to import 'pinject'`) or other errors.

### Summary

- **Recreate the environment** with Python 3.11.
- **Install packages properly** using both `conda` and `pip`.
- **Set the correct interpreter** in VS Code.
- **Configure and test Pylint** to ensure it runs without issues.
